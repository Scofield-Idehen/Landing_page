The Spy Camera is a Python-based application that allows you to capture images and record videos discreetly using your computer's camera. It leverages computer vision libraries like OpenCV to access the camera feed and perform various operations.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: The application runs silently in the background, without displaying any visible windows or indicators, ensuring maximum discretion.
- **Motion Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's motion detection algorithms to automatically capture images or record videos when movement is detected within the camera's field of view.
- **Scheduled Capture**: Schedule the Spy Camera to capture images or record videos at specific times or intervals for continuous monitoring.
- **Remote Access**: Built-in web server or remote access functionality to access captured media from remote locations.
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure various settings like camera resolution, frame rate, motion sensitivity, and storage location for captured media.
- **Secure Storage**: Captured images and videos are securely stored on the local system or can be uploaded to a remote server or cloud storage.
